2. [Download and Configure the pre-compiled binaries](quickstart/configure.html)
3. [Deploy CloudCoder Webapp](quickstart/deploy.html)
4. [Deploy CloudCoder Builder](quickstart/builder.html)

### Other helpful documents

* [cloudcoder.properties features explained](quickstart/cloudcoder.properties.html)

### Notes
This Quickstart guide helps you configure and deploy CloudCoder as quickly as possible.  However:

* Running CloudCoder directly (i.e. without configuring an apache reverse-proxy as detailed in the full [Getting Started](getstarted.html)) will not use SSL to connect to the server.
* Running the webapp and builder on the same machine may not scale up.
